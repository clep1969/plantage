	<p>The Plantage proudly introduces a line of perennials, herbs and bulbs in 4" pots. Get a jump on spring with our line of forced Sunny Startups&#153;. These single-quart specimens with the same Plantage quality are available in trays of 15. The list includes culinary and calming herbs, including some of the more unusual varieties, as well as perennials from A to Z that can be combined in planters or in shade gardens as well as starter perennial beds.</p>

	<p>It's early in the season, but so many of us can't wait for planting time to begin! These plants are perfect for a window wall (especially those kitchen herbs&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;&quot;Bam! Kick it up a notch,&quot; as Emeril would say) or right on your coffee table ... in just the right contaner, of course ... comfy and cozy &#146;til Mother Nature's respite begins and these beauties can be moved into the garden. Some varieties are more tender than others, and some will require special attention on those nights when temperatures are going to dip down. Throw a protective cover over them to protect them from frost.</p>
