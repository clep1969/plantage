			<a name="care"><h1>Care Of Our Plants</h1></a>
			<p align="left">We raise specimen, container-grown perennials of the highest quality, which can be planted any time of year provided the ground is not frozen. These plants are fed with slow-release fertilizers adequate to carry the plant through a nine-month cycle. No additional fertilizer application is necessary during the growing season. A 2-week spray program of insecticide, fungicide and miticide will be helpful in maintaining plants in top condition. Removal of spent blooms will improve appearance and prolong blooming time as well.</p>
