		<p>Lois F. Woodhull, founder and original president of The Plantage, not only set the standard for the perennial industry but changed the way perennials were marketed. It was Lois' deep love of plants that took a basement greenhouse in 1973 to a business venture that today is one of the Northeast's largest and most acclaimed wholesale perennial growers. It was Lois who created the perennial container nursery concept, as well as providing deliveries of her products. A woman in an industry led by men, leading the way with sharp business acumen on a quest for successs.</p>
		<p>Lois had a keen eye for rare and unusual plants. In 1996 Lois Woodhull won international recognition for the selection and cultivation of Festuca glauca &quot;Elijah Blue.&quot; She was also responsible for introducing Cortaderia selloana &quot;Icalma,&quot; native to the mountains of South America, into the North American market. Lois was a pioneer in the nursery industry and an inspiration and mentor to many who now have their own place in today's perennial market.</p>
		<p>In July of 1997, Lois Woodhull passed away of breast cancer, but what she established continues. The Plantage remains a family-owned business dedicated to producing the highest-quality plants. We pay tribute to a remarkable woman who let nothing stop her in pursuit of her vision. She continues to be greatly missed by those of us here at The Plantage and by those in our industry today.</p>
