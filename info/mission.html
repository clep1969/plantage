			<h1>Mission Statement</h1>
			<p>We regularly visit this page and review our goals. This is an ever-evolving process; whenever we review it, we learn from it.</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>The Plantage is <i>the</i> industry's source for rare and unusual perennials and grasses, as well as the more familiar varieties.</li>
					<li>The Plantage maintains the highest standard of excellence for our plants. The health, vigor and the transition our plants make into the garden comes from rigorous time-tested practices. We often hear feedback from our customers saying &quot;When your plants come off the truck, we say, &#145;That&#146;s how plants are supposed to look!&#146;&quot;</li>
					<li>The Plantage views our customers with the highest esteem and is always striving to provide customer service that is unsurpassable.</li>
					<li>With that in mind, we reflect on our performance regularly, constantly working to enhance and strengthen it.</li>
					<li>The Plantage knows there is a plant for every niche in the landscape and believes that is so for people too. We acknowledge that a business affords opportunities to affect its staff, its community and even our world. To this end we are committed to invest in people's lives, to make an impact of a lasting and fulfilling nature.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>Our entire staff is dedicated to the success of our business and yours.</p>
